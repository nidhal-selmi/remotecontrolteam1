# RemoteControlTeam1 SysML Repo

This repository is wired to trigger the Decision Capture Framework (DCF) after merges to `main`.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Set these in `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions`:

- `DCF_API_URL`: Public base URL of your running DCF API.
  - Example: `https://dcf.my-domain.com`
- `DCF_CI_TOKEN`: Token matching `DCF_CI_TOKEN` on the DCF server.

## What the workflow does

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/dcf-merge-review.yml`

On each push to `main`:

1. Calls `POST {DCF_API_URL}/ci/merge` with:
   - `base_ref` = previous commit SHA
   - `head_ref` = current commit SHA
   - `merge_ref` = short SHA
2. Receives a run payload from DCF.
3. Writes a review link into the GitHub Action job summary.

## Local DCF artifact folders

These folders are generated by DCF and ignored by git:

- `decisions/`
- `hierarchies/`
- `mappings/`
- `adrs/`
- `traceability/`
- `runs/`
- `.dcf-state/`

## Notes

- The DCF server must have a local clone of this repo available and up to date when `/ci/merge` is called.
- Review UI is available in DCF at `/reviews/{run_id}`.
